### <ins>Overview</ins>

[Relational Rails](https://github.com/deebot10/relational_rails_1) is a 10-day, 2 person project, during Mod 2 of 4 for Turing School's Back End Engineering Program.

Our challenge was to build a functioning web app consisting of multiple relational databases.

Learning goals and areas of focus consisted of:

- Apply principles of flow control across multiple methods
- Design a one to many relationship using a schema designer
- Write migrations to create tables with columns of varying data types and foreign keys.
- Use Rails to create web pages that allow users to CRUD resources
- Create instance and class methods on a Rails model that use ActiveRecord methods and helpers
- Write model and feature tests that fully cover data logic and potential user behavior

# Little Esty Shop

## Background and Description

"Little Esty Shop" is a group project that requires students to build a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices.

## Learning Goals
- Practice designing a normalized database schema and defining model relationships
- Utilize advanced routing techniques including namespacing to organize and group like functionality together.
- Utilize advanced active record techniques to perform complex database queries
- Practice consuming a public API while utilizing POROs as a way to apply OOP principles to organize code

## Requirements
- must use Rails 5.2.x
- must use PostgreSQL
- all code must be tested via feature tests and model tests, respectively
- must use GitHub branching, team code reviews via GitHub comments, and github projects to track progress on user stories
- must include a thorough README to describe the project
- must deploy completed code to Heroku

## Setup

This project requires Ruby 2.7.2.

* Fork this repository
* Clone your fork
* From the command line, install gems and set up your DB:
    * `bundle`
    * `rails db:create`
* Run the test suite with `bundle exec rspec`.
* Run your development server with `rails s` to see the app in action.

## Phases
